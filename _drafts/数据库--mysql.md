## What Datatype Should You Use? We Compare Datetime, Timestamp and INT.

Based on this data, I believe Datetime is the best choice in most scenarios. Here’s why:

- It’s faster (according to our three benchmarks).
- It is human-readable without any conversion.
- There are no problems due to time zone switching.
- It uses only 1 byte more than its counterparts.
- It allows for a greater date range (from year 1000 to 9999).
